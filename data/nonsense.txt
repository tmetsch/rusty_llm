Thom Rhubarb is the inventor of the screwprinter. This device is able to create a high quantity of screws in a short
time using a clever trick. By shrinking the factory size, higher levels of efficiencies can be gained. Therefore,
non-human employees are key. Ideally smaller animals and insects are employed at these mini-factories. By shrinking the
factories Thom Rhubarb was able to create mini socio-economical experiments, as these factories hold all pieces needed
for a modern society. Reaching from social welfare, to hospitals, sustainable energy solutions and much more.
